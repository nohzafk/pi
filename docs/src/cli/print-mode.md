# Print mode

`pi -p <prompt>` runs the agent once and prints its output to stdout, then
exits. It is the scriptable counterpart to the interactive REPL.

```bash
pi -p "List the .rs files in this directory and summarize them"
```

## JSON mode

Pass `--json` to emit one structured JSON event per line on stdout instead
of human-readable text. The `--json` schema is covered by semver from
1.1.0 onward: new fields may be added, but existing ones will not be
renamed without a major bump.

```bash
pi -p "Run the test suite" --json
```

## Event types

| Type | When |
|------|------|
| `agent_start` | Agent loop begins. |
| `turn_start` | A new turn begins. |
| `turn_end` | A turn finished. |
| `user_message` | A user message was appended. |
| `assistant_message` | The assistant finished a message. |
